# CS440_CH04_Demo_Malloian_Ammar
For my CS 440 test My Justification here 

I picked the MIT License. The reasoning of my picking was due to the simplicity of the license and effective of it. While choosing, github had a link to another website called https://choosealicense.com/ that explained the difference in the licenses offered. I figured after learning the differences of the types of licenses picking the MIT license. This is a very open source license that is offered. There is a condition while using this which is that the people have to preserve my copyright notice intact and does not hold me liable.
